# 1. Overview

<div class="service-card card">

I offer personalised tutoring and academic mentoring in biology, chemistry, and physics ‚Äî with a special focus on molecular biology, genetics, and computational biology.

With a PhD in Computational Biology, an MBA, and over 15 years of experience teaching and mentoring at leading universities including the University of Edinburgh, the University of Nottingham, and the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology & Genetics (MPI-CBG), I help students:

- Build strong foundations in scientific and quantitative disciplines
- Develop critical thinking, analytical, and problem-solving skills
- Learn programming and data analysis for modern biology (Python, R, bioinformatics)
- Prepare for exams, coursework, and research projects with confidence

I‚Äôve taught on international PhD programmes, trained researchers through Software and Data Carpentry, and supported students from A-Level to postdoctoral level. My sessions combine academic rigour with practical insight from both academia and industry (AstraZeneca, EMBL, Institut Pasteur, VIB, ETH), helping learners understand not just what to study, but why it matters in real-world science.
