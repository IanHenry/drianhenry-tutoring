title: Tutoring & Mentoring in Science and Data
---

# 1. Overview

<div class="service-card card">
I offer personalised tutoring and academic mentoring for students in **biology, genetics, molecular sciences, and data-driven biology**.

With a **PhD in Computational Biology**, an **MBA**, and over **15 years of teaching, mentoring, and research leadership**, I help learners:

- Build strong foundations in molecular biology, genetics, and experimental sciences
- Develop critical thinking, analytical, and problem-solving skills
- Learn programming and data analysis for modern biology (Python, R, and bioinformatics workflows)
- Prepare for university coursework, lab projects, and research assignments
- Receive guidance on academic writing, dissertations, thesis projects, and career development

I have taught **bioinformatics modules** on the Dresden International PhD program, am a **certified Software and Data Carpentry instructor**, and have supervised students from **undergraduates to postdocs**. My professional experience spans **Max Planck Institutes** and industry with **AstraZeneca**, giving students insight into both academic and real-world scientific contexts.

Whether you are preparing for **A-Levels**, working on **undergraduate or master‚Äôs projects**, or tackling **research-based projects**, I tailor sessions to your goals and skill level, combining academic rigour with practical problem-solving.
