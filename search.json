Overview\n\nI offer personalised tutoring and academic mentoring in biology, chemistry, and physics ‚Äî with a special focus on molecular biology, genetics, and computational biology.\nWith a PhD in Computational Biology, an MBA, and over 15 years of experience teaching and mentoring at leading universities including the University of Edinburgh, the University of Nottingham, and the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology & Genetics (MPI-CBG), I help students:\n\nBuild strong foundations in scientific and quantitative disciplines\nDevelop critical thinking, analytical, and problem-solving skills\nLearn programming and data analysis for modern biology (Python, R, bioinformatics)\nPrepare for exams, coursework, and research projects with confidence\n\nI‚Äôve taught on international PhD programmes, trained researchers through Software and Data Carpentry, and supported students from A-Level to postdoctoral level. My sessions combine academic rigour with practical insight from both academia and industry (AstraZeneca, EMBL, Institut Pasteur, VIB, ETH), helping learners understand not just what to study, but why it matters in real-world science.\n\n\n\n2. Subjects & Levels\n\n\nA-Level Tutoring \nSubjects: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics\n\nFocus on strong conceptual understanding and exam preparation\nIntro to computational thinking and data analysis\nPreparation for university entry in life sciences, computing, and medicine\n\n\n\nUndergraduate & Master‚Äôs Support  \nSubjects: Molecular Biology, Genetics, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics\n\nProgramming and data analysis in Python and R\nExperimental design, data interpretation, and statistical reasoning\nGuidance on academic writing, dissertations, and thesis projects\n\n\n\nPhD & Postgraduate Mentoring  \nFocus Areas: Structuring computational biology and data-intensive research, multi-omics analysis, reproducible workflows\n\nSupervision support, publication strategy, and project delivery\nMentoring for academic and career planning\nTransition into industry or advanced research roles\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Teaching Philosophy\n\n\nPersonalized & Practical Approach  \n\nEach session is tailored to your goals and skill level\nCombines academic rigour with hands-on problem solving\nEncourages critical thinking and independent learning\n\n\n\nMentoring Across Levels \n\nSupport for A-Level students, undergraduates, and postgraduates\nGuidance on academic projects, dissertations, and research planning\nMentorship for career development in science, data, and industry\n\n\n\nGlobal & Interdisciplinary Experience \n\nLived and worked abroad in Germany (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology & Genetics)\nLed diverse international teams in academia and industry\nManaged global teams and cross-functional projects\nApplies cross-cultural insights to teaching, mentoring, and teamwork\n\n\n\n\n\n4. How It Works\n\n\nOne-to-One Sessions \n\nOnline sessions via Zoom or Teams, tailored to your goals and skill level\nPersonalized learning plans for A-Level, Undergraduate, or Postgraduate students\nPractical exercises in biology, genetics, computational biology, and data analysis\nGuidance for academic writing, dissertations, and project planning\n\n\n\nInitial Consultation \n\nUnderstand the learner‚Äôs background, objectives, and preferred learning style\nSet clear outcomes for each tutoring or mentoring session\nPlan a structured progression across topics, from core concepts to applied projects\n\n\n\nMentorship & Feedback \n\nContinuous feedback on assignments, coding exercises, and research projects\nMentoring on career pathways, graduate study, or transitioning into industry\nDrawing on experience supervising students up to Postdocs, leading diverse international teams, and working at Max Planck and AstraZeneca\n\n\n\nOptional Career & Professional Guidance \n\nIncorporates coaching elements for advanced learners, bridging academic and professional development\nIncludes insight from MBA studies, leadership experience, and international project management\nLinks to Coaching ‚Üí for full professional development programs\n\n\n\n\n\n5.
